# Quantis Core

Quantis Core is an evidence-first experiment in latent predictive anomaly
detection for infrastructure telemetry.

The first vertical slice answers a deliberately narrow question:

> Can a latent predictive detector trained on normal operation tolerate isolated
> telemetry noise while detecting held-out, correlated structural drift?

The repository does not yet claim production OpenTelemetry ingestion, a full JEPA
training objective, or autonomous remediation. See
[`docs/specs/vertical-slice.md`](docs/specs/vertical-slice.md) for the executable
claim and acceptance criteria.

## Run it

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
.venv/bin/python -m quantis_core evaluate --output artifacts/evaluation
```

The final command writes machine-readable results, a Markdown report, the exact
scenario manifest, and model artifacts.
